        <article title="About Me">
            <img id="me" src="images/me.jpg" alt="Me">
            <p>I'm a techy at heart. I love computers and technology. I love to build and create which is what brought me to web development. I want to keep learning and create helpful sites for people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've always struggled writing about myself, I tend to live by the moto of actions speak louder than words. This helps me focus more
                on what perspective others see rather than my own perspective of myself. Whenever I start a new job one of the first things I hear from people is how welcoming and friendly I am.
            </p>
            <p>I was taught to treat people the way I'd want to be treated and I apply this every day of my life.
                The second thing I get when starting a new job is "have you done this before"?
                I think most people assume that I've had prior experience because of how fast I can pick things up.
                To be honest I think there's only been one or two jobs throughout my carreer where I have had prior experience.
                When given the opportunity I have always been able to achieve more than expected.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I decided to take the leap into coding and web development I was really scared.
                    I've had a passion for computer science and technology for years; but I've never thought of making it my carreer.
                    Within my first week in this bootcamp I've found so much joy from writting code.
                    I've excelled in my class and have had opportunities to help others comprehend the complexities of coding.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I  cant wait to keep learning and expand my knowledge to more established technologies and companies.
                    I thank you for the time you've taken to get to know me and I hope to get to know you as well.
                </p>
