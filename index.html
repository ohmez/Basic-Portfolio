            <img id="me" src="images/me.jpg" alt="Me">
            <p>I'm a techy at heart. I love computers and technology. I love to build and create which is what brought me to web development. I want to keep learning and create helpful sites for people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've always struggled writing about myself, I tend to live by the moto of actions speak louder than words. This helps me focus more
                on what perspective others see rather than my own perspective of myself. Whenever I start a new job one of the first things I hear from people is how welcoming and friendly I am.
            </p>
            <p>I was taught to treat people the way I'd want to be treated and I apply this every day of my life. The second thing I get when starting a new job is "have you done this before"?
                I think most people assume that I've had prior experience because of how fast I can pick things up. To be honest I think there's only been one or two jobs throughout my carreer where I have had prior experience.
                When given the opportunity I have always been able to achieve more than expected.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I decided to take the leap into coding and web development I was really scared I'd finally taken on a challenge that I wouldn't be able to pick up quickly.
                    Luckily that's not the case, within my first week on any job or in this bootcamp I've always found 1-2 things that could be improved or altered for easier comprehension.</p>
